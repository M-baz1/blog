        <h4>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects </h4>
        <p>
            Cost risk -  A digital project cost usually exceeds the budget set out for it this  usually due to poor estimating the initial cost
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Schedule risk - the risk that activities will take longer than expected. This will also affect other aspects of the project such as an increase in cost
        </p>
        
        <P>
            Performance risk - the risk that the project will fail to produce results consistent with project specifications.

        <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT </h3>
        <p>
             Before going ahead making our website we need to plan it. I will plan my project by creating a trello board and split the task of creating a website into several smaller tasks. I will sketch a  an idea on paper of what i want the website to look like. I will use trello boards i can break the big task of creating a website into several smaller tasks and then complete each smaller task to list each taski need doing in order to complete my website. From the list of task i can focus on each objective and complete them in order to make my website. I will use visual studio for all the HTML and CSS for my website. I will be using this as i have used so i am familiar with the interface and it is quite easy to navigate and use. Github will also be used to upload our html and css with its content from visual studio to a webpage.                
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software  </h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Selecting the right it hardware and software for your digital project is vital. Depending on your project you will decide what you will be using. When deciding on your hardware you will need to take some of these factors into account : will you need a local network, data storage capacity, weather the data will be stored in physical equipment or in the cloud.
        </p>
        
        <P>
            For my project i will be using certain software systems to complete it :
        </P>
        <P>
             TTrello - i chose to use trello because it is a time management tool which will help me on this project. Trello allows me to list the tasks i need to complete for this project and also can label each task. It allows me to comment on each task so i can refer to them later on when making adjustments to the tasks in projects.
        </P>
        <p>
            Visual studio - i chose to use visual studio as my text editor because of the services offered.it supports a variety of languages from default including javascript, html and css.
        </p>
        <P>
            Github - As we were going to do our HTML and CSS on visual studio code we needed a way to upload all of this to the web. The most simplest and easiest way is to to use github which creates and stores a repository for you selected page which then will be published as a web page.
        </P>
        <br>
       
    </div>
    <div>
       <h£>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. –</h> 
       <p>T
           rello - trello has helped me quite a lot on this project as it helps me break down the project into smaller more manageable tasks. I can easily split the task up into three categories to do, doing, and completed this really helps me as i know exactly what i have done and should be doing. It also made me stick to the plan as i was constantly referring back to the trello boards and the task listed which made the overall project easier.    </p>
       <p>
            Visual studio code has also been a vital part of this project as this is were all our html and css was done. A useful feature offered by vs code was that the syntax is colour coded depending on the language your using.
       </p>
       <p>
            Github was also very useful as we constantly added to and made changes to both our HTML and CSS in visual studio code. The version control allowed us to push all our work to the github repository after any changes were made which made it very useful to us. We will also use github to publish our blog to a webpage.
       </p>

        <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that
                impact digital projects</h2>

        <h2>Outcome 2</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed  </h3>
        <br>
        <P>
            All the tools i used Trello, Visual studio code and Github were all very useful in creating the project. I was happy with all the tools and found them very useful and easy to use. Trello was a very useful tool to manage my project and helped me keep track of all the work that i had completed and that needed to be completed. Visual studio code was a vital tool for this project as we used its text editor for our HTML and CSS. i was happy with this text editor as i had used it before whilst learning JavaScript.Github was also very useful as i was constantly changing my html and css so using Github i could easily push any changes i made to my website.
        </P>
        <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate </h3>
        <P>
            All these tools we used for our project were not only very appropriate in creating this project. We needed software were we would use HTML, CSS and put our content in so we used visual studio. As we have used visual studio prior to this for learning the basics of javascript it was easy to navigate and to use. Trello was very useful in managing this project allowing us to break it down into smaller tasks so we could focus on each separate task, however as we did this project individually we didn't utilize trello to its fullest as we did in our other project were we designed an app working in teams. Github was also a key tool in this project as we created our webpage blog through uploading our vscode blog repository on github were we could publish our blog.
        </P>
        <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project  </h3>
        <P>
            My project is good in terms of content and layout. It has a navigation bar splitting each assignment up and the homepage so it is easy to navigate. The fonts and colours used are also a strength as they are clear making the website easier to use and accessibility. As i have limited knowledge of HTML and CSS i think my website is quite good overall. If i had more time i would use more elements in my website for example having an email, or an animation on my website.
        </P>
        <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>
        <P>
            Further improvements i could make to this project would be create a better layout whilst keeping in mind how they would look on a different number of devices such as a smartphone or a tablet. I could also have added a video clip to make my website more engaging with the user. In addition to this i could add an email section for contact regarding any questions.
        </P>
        <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
        <P>
            I think my final website is fit for it purpose of a blog. I have a navigation bar splitting up into its relevant sections, buttons to move from each page and a section with references. I believe my site includes everything i set out to do and meets all its requirements
        </P>
        <br>
        <h2>Outcome 3</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity an efficiency</h3>
        <P>
            Trello - trello was beneficial on this task has it helped me be more productive.it did this by having all the tasks and outcomes displayed chronologically in order of completion so i could see exactly where i was and what tasks i needed to focus on. As this was a individual task i believe i did not utilise all of the features offered by trello which we would have used if we were working in teams. If we were in a business situation i think this project would have been a team project which would have made this project more efficient.
        </P>
        <P>
             Github - github was used for a place to keep online storage, it allowed us to upload our code from vs studio to and offered a git pages for testing of our site. The disadvantage of using git is sometimes it can be unclear as it only used the command line tool due to it not having a graphical interface.
        </P>
        <p>
             Vs code - the advantage of using vs code was its ability to highlight syntax and structural errors this was very helpful because i could see exactly where the problems were occuring for me in the code making it is easier for me to modify and correct. It also had the ability to autosave and you can write both HTML and CSS in it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>
        <P>
                Ways we could have made our website more efficient is to design and code it but having it mobile friendly a top priority. We should code for mobile device users first as most of the websites are accessed through mobile devices so this would enhance the user experience.optimizing the size of the image displayed on the page we can reduce site loading time.
        </P>
        <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
        <P>
            To improve our productivity for future digital projects i would learn and gain more knowledge on html and css and also try to use and implement javascript on making the web site.having more knowledge and more experience in completing digital projects will ultimately make me better at the skill so i would be able to complete future projects in a quicker time increasing the efficiency of the project. In addition to this if we work in teams on digital projects the task can be completed more efficiently as the tasks would have been spread out across the team.
        </P>
        <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h3>
        <P>
            To test digital projects you we can use in-code testing to confirm expected results. We can also use different browsers to check our website and its performance across different browsers. We can also increase the performance by making the website more responsive for mobile and laptop
