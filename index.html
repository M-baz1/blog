        <h3>    About me </h3>
        <P>Having been brought up in a society where technology is constantly advancing and evolving it is constantly  
            creating disruptions across every organisation in every sector. I became fascinated with technology and starting 
            engaging with emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence. I then started an online course
            on udemy on cyber security and ethical hacking, even though this course was very good as i learnt a lot of practical
            techniques i didn't really learn theoretical knowledge behind it and how it would be applied in real life business 
            situations. I then came across code nation and it courses it offers so i wanted to go gain a deeper understanding
            of cyber security so i joined and completed the cyber security and digital forensics course . I also saw they 
            offered a software development course i decided to enroll onto the course so i can gain an insight  and create a
            new skill set in coding. I believe gaining these qualifications will give me a strong foundation of skills in 
            programming and cyber security to go into digital technology.</P>
