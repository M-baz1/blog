        </h2>
        <P>
                Copyright is a legal right, giving the owner control over their work and how it is used. It gives creators protection against use of their work without permission. Owners of copyright can use, sell or licence a work to a third party.

        <P>
                There is one exception to copyright infringement and that is fair use. It is the limited and reasonable use of copyrighted material that does not interfere with an ownerâ€™s rights.Fair use is appropriate for public benefit purposes, like research and information. . 
        </P>
        <P>
                Websites are particularly open to abuse, especially theft of content and images. You should assume that files will be accessed randomly, downloaded as individual chunks, and distributed out of context. It is therefore important to include a copyright notice on as many individually deliverable items as possible:

        <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages andHow we can overcome them </h2>    
        <p>
                The Web must be accessible to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. Indeed, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, as a basic human right.
        </p>
        <P>
                Accessibility supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as others, such as older people, people in rural areas, and people in developing countries.There is also a strong business case for accessibility. Accessibility overlaps with other best practices such as mobile web design, device independence, multi-modal interaction, usability, design for older users, and search engine optimization .

              <b> Blindness</b> -
                Blindness makes it impossible for a person to physically view the display screen so therefore they won't be able to see the graphical features of the website. Many people who have this disability try to overcome it by using a voice output programs.

        <P>
                <b>Colour blindness</b> -

             People with colour blindness have difficulty with viewing certain colour that may be used on the webpage. A way we can make it easier for people with colour blindness is keep the webpage to a minimal design with symbols used as well as colours.
